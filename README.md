## Description

The WeatherBoard challenge is a web application that allows users to search for the current weather and 5-day forecast of any city in the world. Users can simply type in the name of the city they want to search for in the search bar, and the app will display the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the current weather conditions. Additionally, the app stores the user's recent searches in local storage, allowing them to quickly see their past searches. The app utilizes various APIs to gather weather data and display the information in an intuitive and easy-to-read format. WeatherBoard is a simple yet powerful tool for anyone looking to stay informed about the weather in their local area or anywhere in the world.
